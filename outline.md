2. Write a script that takes a filename as a command-line argument and prints the number of lines in the file.
3. Write a script that takes a string as input and checks if it contains the word "hello".
4. Write a script that reads a list of filenames from a file and copies them to a new directory.
5. Write a script that uses a loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10, with each number on a new line.
6. Write a script that prompts the user for a name and prints a greeting with their name.
7. Write a script that reads a list of numbers from a file and calculates their average.

## Conclusion

By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation in Bash scripting and be able to create your own scripts to automate tasks and simplify your workflow.
